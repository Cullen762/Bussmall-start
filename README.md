## Planning

### Overall what is needed
    An app that displays three products side by side randomly. The user can only click on one. When a selection is made the products change and three more appear.
    When the user has made 25 selections the result of which products were selected are collected.

    This data is then compiled to determine which products are the most desirable as well as what percentage each product was clicked on.

### Technical inventory

      User stories, scaffolding and client provided assets (Img's).

  ####JS
      Randomly select and present three images side by side.
      Respond to user input by changing the three images
      Store the data from user input
      Compile results, which imgs had the most clicks and the percentage of each img clicked when it is presented

      Array = IMG
      Array = User input which IMG is selected


      A for loop to run through the IMG array using .length


      FN to display images
        event listener for input
        event handler  for user input
       .push user response into array.

       how to randomly select three imgs?
       short loops three index's?
       nested loops to move across the array?
        two arrays?

#### HTML
divs for display
headers
divs for tally?
select buttons or link to animations?

CSS make it funky


##Phases
 Make Plan
### one

 JS:
Start with random number generator, give pics a value and log that into the console to test code.
store results in var
use constructor function
array for a constructor?

put results in a table?





 arrays:
      - imgs

      - user input
