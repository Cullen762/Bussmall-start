2 -As a market research team member I want to implement a focus group and technology to gather data about potential products. This data will determine the desirability of the products my client intends to sell.

3 - As a market research team member I want to record the data collected not just from items that are chosen by focus group members. I also want to record the number of times an item is selected when it is shown in the app.

4 - As a market research team member I want to compile the data from: which products were chosen the most, by focus group members. As well as how many clicks an item receives when it is presented.
